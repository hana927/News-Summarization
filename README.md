# News-Summarization
Summarization in natural language processing (NLP) is the process of automatically generating a concise and coherent summary of a given text or document. The goal of text summarization is to extract the most important and relevant information from the original content while preserving its main ideas and meaning.

Text summarization can be applied to various types of text, including articles, news stories, research papers, emails, and more. It is a valuable tool in information retrieval and text processing, as it allows users to quickly grasp the key points of a lengthy document without having to read the entire text.
